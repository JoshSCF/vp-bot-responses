"blackscreen": "1. Have you installed the pack correctly? \n 2. Have you disabled every other pack? \n 3. Do you have a file named codehandler.bin (for mission mode to work) in the riivolution folder on the root of your SD card? This is not needed for any other mode. \n 4. Are you sure you have every single file and have not changed anything with said files.",
"linefreeze": "This is an issue many people blame on Variety Pack for, this is caused by riivolution save data confliction which is theorized to be conflicting because of the 'Ultimate License Unlocker' code (this code has been replaced by a different code as of v1.31). A possible fix for this could be to enable 'Save game from CTGP' in your riivolution launch settings.",
"missionmode": "Mission Mode is an unfinished mode for Mario Kart Wii which has been re-added into Variety Pack as a new mode. Any issues you may encounter with this mode is possibly due to the unfinished nature of this mode.",
"latest": "The latest update for Variety Pack is v1.31 and v2.0 is currently in development. Also a special version of Variety Pack called Variety Pack Lite is a good alternative for people who have smaller SD card and is currently on v2.0!",
"error": "As far as the devs know, the reason why the 'An error has occurred' image appears on bootup is because you probably have not installed the pack correctly and are missing some files perhaps. Please re-install the pack and notifty the devs if the issue still hasn't been resolved.",
"online": "Variety Pack and Variety Pack Lite both support Wiimmfi, so all error codes are able to be looked up on https://wiimmfi.de/error also keep in mind, Variety Pack and Variety Pack Lite DO NOT have people playing all the time so don't be surprised or worried if you cannot find anyone searching for a match.",
"lite": "Variety Pack Lite is a distribtion that features the 32 standard Mario Kart Wii tracks. However, this pack does contain most of the features from Variety Pack. This pack is intended as a Variety Pack twist on the original game, as well as being a smaller download size for people with smaller sized SD cards. \n This pack was created by JαmεςH with some help here and there from some of the original Variety Team members.",
"frantic": "Frantic Mode is a new mode which uses ItemSlot.bin in the Common.szs. However, the chances of getting any item is completely equal. But Thunder Clouds were removed entirely and you can no longer get the POW Block in 1st making it slightly more balanced.",
"bsshowdown": "Blue Shell Showdown is a mode which heavily increases the probability of blue shells being received from the item roulette while every other item has been revoked of it's probability or have been made for the lower positions only. As we don't want 1st place to receive a blue shell, the ItemSlot.bin has been modified to give first place dodge items such as mushrooms or stars which have obviously been balanced depending on their power. Like in normal gameplay, blue shells will only appear after 30 seconds into the race.",
